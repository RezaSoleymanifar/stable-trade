`stable-trade` is a stock trading API for
`stable-baselines3`, a deep reinforcement learning package based
on `pytorch`.
Our API boasts an end-to-end experience from *data collection*,
*training models*, *rule-based strategies*, and sending
*trade requests* to AmeriTrade Developre account.
This enables algotraders to focus on model fine-tuning,
feature engineering, and deploying 
algorithms as opposed to writing boilerplate codes.

We provide detailed examples along with a highly abstract API that
standardizes algotrading functions, enabling developers to focus
on implementation and spend less time on design thinking.

## installation

To install the package use:
```buildoutcfg
pip install stable-trade
